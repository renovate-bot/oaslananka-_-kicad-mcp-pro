# Tools Reference

See the README for the complete tool list.

Recommended startup flow:

1. `kicad_get_version()`
2. `kicad_set_project()`
3. `kicad_list_tool_categories()`
4. Inspect resources such as `kicad://project/info`

## Release-Critical Tools

For agent-driven design work, these tools form the minimum safe review loop:

- `project_quality_gate()`
- `project_full_validation_loop()`
- `schematic_connectivity_gate()`
- `pcb_placement_quality_gate()`
- `pcb_transfer_quality_gate()`
- `pcb_score_placement()`
- `manufacturing_quality_gate()`
- `validate_footprints_vs_schematic()`
- `project_gate_trend()`

`export_manufacturing_package()` is a release-only tool and hard-blocks unless the
full project gate is `PASS`.

The `manufacturing` profile keeps its export surface narrow: use `get_board_stats()`
and `export_manufacturing_package()` for the gated handoff. Low-level `export_*()`
tools remain available in broader profiles such as `full` and `minimal` for debugging
or interchange output, and those direct exports do not enforce `project_quality_gate()`.
KiCad 10 installations that advertise ODB++ support also expose `export_odb()` for
zip-compressed ODB++ manufacturing interchange alongside IPC-2581.

For flat multi-sheet projects, `export_bom()` and
`validate_footprints_vs_schematic()` consolidate sibling `.kicad_sch` files in the
active project directory. Numbered sync-conflict duplicates such as
`project 2.kicad_sch` are ignored by this automatic consolidation.

Live LCSC/JLCPCB pricing tools fail closed for manufacturing-sensitive output:
`lib_get_bom_with_pricing()` uses explicit `LCSC`/`LCSC Part` fields and leaves
unresolved lines when a part code is absent instead of guessing from a generic
value string.

## Design Intent Tools

These tools persist the engineering assumptions that intent-aware placement checks use:

- `project_set_design_intent()`
- `project_get_design_intent()`
- `project_get_design_spec()`
- `project_infer_design_spec()`
- `project_validate_design_spec()`
- `project_generate_design_prompt()`
- `project_get_next_action()`

Current intent fields:

- connector references
- decoupling pairs
- critical nets
- power-tree references
- analog references
- digital references
- sensor-cluster references
- RF keepout regions
- manufacturer / manufacturer tier

## Schematic Safety Tools

Generated schematics should run these checks before PCB transfer:

- `sch_add_missing_junctions()` scans wires and inserts missing junctions on T-intersections.
- `sch_route_wire_between_pins()` routes around symbol bodies with A*/Z-route fallback.
- `schematic_connectivity_gate()` verifies the resulting schematic connectivity.

`pcb_sync_from_schematic(force=False, auto_place=True)` now runs the pre-sync gate by
default. Use `force=True` only for debugging known-bad intermediate states.

## Placement, Routing, and Power Tools

The default agent layout loop is:

- `pcb_sync_from_schematic(auto_place=True)` to transfer and place footprints.
- `pcb_place_decoupling_caps()` to apply common 100n/1u/10u proximity rules.
- `route_export_dsn()`, `route_autoroute_freerouting()`, and `route_import_ses()` for autorouting.
- `check_power_integrity()` for lightweight PDN mesh voltage-drop screening.

`check_power_integrity()` can also estimate simple AC PDN impedance when frequency
points and decoupling capacitor values are supplied. The result reports impedance
violations separately from DC voltage-drop violations.

## Error Responses

Tool execution failures are returned as MCP tool errors with `isError: true` and
structured content containing `error_code`, `message`, and `hint`. The text content
still includes a readable summary for clients that do not consume structured output.

## Critic Resources

The MCP resource surface mirrors the current review state so an agent can iterate safely:

- `kicad://analysis/materials`
- `kicad://analysis/defaults`
- `kicad://analysis/stackup`
- `kicad://project/quality_gate`
- `kicad://project/fix_queue`
- `kicad://project/spec`
- `kicad://project/gate_history`
- `kicad://project/next_action`
- `kicad://schematic/connectivity`
- `kicad://board/placement_quality`
- `kicad://gate/{gate_name}`

The analysis resources are JSON-first. They expose dielectric material data,
analysis model defaults and schemas, and the active stackup so SI, PI, and EMC
workflows can cite their physical assumptions instead of relying on hidden defaults.

## Prompt Workflows

Built-in prompt helpers for the critic/fixer loop:

- `design_review_loop`
- `fix_blocking_issues`
- `manufacturing_release_checklist`
- `professional_circuit_design`
- `post_placement_routing`
