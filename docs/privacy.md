# Privacy Policy

**Effective date:** 2026-05-15
**Service:** KiCad MCP Pro
**Operator:** Osman Aslan (oaslananka)
**Contact:** https://github.com/oaslananka

## 1. Overview

KiCad MCP Pro is a **local stdio MCP server** that runs entirely on your machine.
It communicates with KiCad via the KiCad CLI and local file system.
No data is transmitted to external servers by the server itself.

---

## 2. Data We Collect

| Data Type | Collected? | Notes |
|-----------|-----------|-------|
| Personal information | **No** | |
| File contents (schematics, PCBs) | **No** | Processed locally only |
| Usage telemetry | **No** | |
| IP addresses | **No** | |
| Cookies | **No** | |

KiCad MCP Pro does not have a backend, does not phone home, and does not store
any user data.

---

## 3. Local Processing Only

All tool calls (DRC, export, schematic parsing, etc.) are executed by spawning
`kicad-cli` on the **user's local machine**. Results are returned to the calling
MCP client (e.g. Claude Desktop) over a local stdio transport. Nothing leaves
the user's machine through this server.

---

## 4. Optional Integrations

If the user configures optional integrations (e.g. Freerouting via Docker, Nexar
component API), those third-party services are governed by their own privacy
policies. KiCad MCP Pro passes only the minimum data required for each
integration.

---

## 5. Children's Privacy

This software is a developer tool not directed at children under 13. We do not
knowingly collect data from children.

---

## 6. Changes

If this policy changes materially, the effective date above will be updated and
the change will be noted in the repository CHANGELOG.
