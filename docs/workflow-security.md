# Workflow Security

## Required Posture

- Default workflow permissions are `contents: read`.
- Jobs that publish, release, mirror, deploy, attest, or mutate issues/labels use
  job-scoped permissions and explicit repository or environment guards.
- Normal CI, lint, test, docs, CodeQL, Gitleaks, Trivy, and workflow-security
  checks run on pull requests and canonical pushes without stale repository
  guards.
- Third-party Actions are pinned to full commit SHAs resolved from upstream refs.
  Do not replace these with fabricated SHAs.
- Shell steps must pass GitHub expression values through `env:` before using
  them in scripts.

## Local Checks

```bash
corepack npm run workflows:lint
corepack npm run workflows:security
```

`workflows:lint` parses workflow YAML and runs actionlint. `workflows:security`
runs zizmor offline at high severity or above. Medium findings such as checkout
credential persistence are still reviewed, but high findings block the local and
CI gate.

## Pinning Updates

When updating a pinned Action, resolve the new ref directly from GitHub, for
example:

```bash
git ls-remote --tags https://github.com/actions/checkout.git 'refs/tags/v4^{}'
```

If a tag cannot be resolved, do not guess. Leave the old pin in place or document
the exact unresolved action and stop the change.
