# Reviewer Test Prompts

These prompts are copy-paste runnable in Claude Desktop, Cursor, VS Code MCP, or any MCP client connected to KiCad MCP Pro.

Fixture project root: `tests/fixtures/benchmark_projects/pass_sensor_node/demo.kicad_pro`.
Use absolute paths in the actual client configuration when running locally.
A wrong path failure means the client pointed to a missing file; it is not a server bug.

## p1-health

### Exact Prompt

```text
Call kicad-mcp-pro's health check and tell me which subsystems are ready.
```

### Fixture

- Fixture project root: `tests/fixtures/benchmark_projects/pass_sensor_node/demo.kicad_pro`.
- Fixture directory: `tests/fixtures/benchmark_projects/pass_sensor_node/`.
- Use an absolute path in the client configuration if the client requires one.
- Do not substitute a private board or unpublished customer design.

### Expected Tool Call Sequence

1. `kicad_get_version`

### PASS Response Shape

- PASS criterion: Response includes version string and KiCad CLI status.
- The response names the fixture project.
- The response includes a concise status summary.
- The response separates warnings from blockers.
- The response does not expose local usernames or hostnames.
- The response does not invent successful writes when a tool was read-only.
- The response describes next actions when a gate blocks export.

### Typical Wrong-Path Failure

- Failure shape: the client passes a path that does not exist on the reviewer machine.
- Expected server behavior: return a clear path or project selection error.
- Reason it is not a server bug: MCP clients must provide a valid local fixture path.
- Reviewer fix: use the repository checkout path and the fixture path listed above.
- Retest: rerun the same prompt after correcting the path.

### Reviewer Notes

- Keep this test in a clean checkout.
- Do not run against private work files.
- Do not paste environment variables containing secrets.
- Keep screenshots cropped to the client and terminal content only.
- Record the result in the listing review notes if requested.
