# KiCad 10 Variants

The `variant_*` tools build effective BOM variants from the active schematic and, on KiCad 10 style projects, store their state in the active `.kicad_pro` under the `variants` section.

## Tools

- `variant_list()` lists the known variants plus the default and active selections.
- `variant_create(name, base_variant=None)` creates a new variant or clones an existing one.
- `variant_set_active(name)` switches the active variant.
- `variant_set_component_override(...)` writes per-component enabled/value/footprint overrides.
- `variant_diff_bom(a, b)` returns a JSON BOM diff between two variants.
- `variant_export_bom(variant, format="csv")` writes a variant-specific BOM under `output/variants/`.
- Active variants are forwarded to compatible `kicad-cli` export commands through `--variant`.

## Notes

When no valid `.kicad_pro` file is available, the tools fall back to the historical `.kicad-mcp/variants.json` sidecar so older or fixture-style environments still work safely.
