# Graphical DRC Rules

For KiCad 10 graphical DRC editor compatibility, the `drc_rule_*` tools manage the active `.kicad_dru` file directly.

## Tools

- `drc_list_rules(include_custom=True)`
- `drc_rule_create(...)`
- `drc_rule_delete(rule_name)`
- `drc_rule_enable(rule_name, enabled=True)`
- `drc_export_rules(output_path=None)`

## Behavior

Custom rules are written directly into `.kicad_dru` through an S-expression-aware parser rather than regex block replacement. Enable/disable state is stored in `.kicad-mcp/drc_rules_state.json`, and disabled rules are neutralized with `severity ignore` when needed.
