## [Unreleased]

## [2.3.0] - 2026-04-16

### Added

- KiCad 10 sidecar-backed design variants with BOM diff/export helpers.
- Time-domain routing helpers, tuning profiles, graphical DRC rule management, 3D PDF export, and manufacturing import commands.
- KiCad Studio context resource support, local HTTP bridge documentation, `.well-known` discovery metadata, and Azure DevOps pipeline definition.
- Unit/property tests and KiCad 10 benchmark fixtures for new routing, variant, design-intent, and studio flows.

### Changed

- Added inferred MCP tool annotations, progress reporting for long-running tools, and client-side sampling integration in the auto-fix loop.
- Hardened cache invalidation, path handling, release documentation, and manual GitHub fallback guidance around Azure DevOps-first CI/CD.
- Normalized project documentation and user-facing messages to consistent English wording.

### Fixed

- Removed stale TTL cache behavior across project/schematic/PCB mutations and test runs.
- Stabilized schematic move behavior to use deterministic file-based updates during automated flows.
- Aligned quality gates, router profile declarations, lint/type expectations, and release metadata for full-suite validation.

## [2.0.2] - 2026-04-14

### Fixed

- Restored complete sdist/wheel contents for package installs and `uvx` entrypoints.
- Preserved environment-based MCP client configuration unless CLI options explicitly override it.
- Preferred KiCad 10 `pcb export gerbers` and kept singular `gerber` as a fallback.
- Rejected export output traversal/absolute path writes and escaped custom symbol strings.

### Changed

- Updated Docker, registry, Smithery, docs, and security metadata for the 2.x release line.

## [2.0.1] - 2026-04-13

### Added

- Project-level quality, connectivity, placement, and manufacturing release gates for agent-guided review loops.
- Design intent storage plus quality/fix-queue resources and benchmark release-gate fixtures.

### Changed

- Hard-blocked manufacturing package export when the project fails production quality gates.
- Tightened release workflows, startup diagnostics, and validation-driven agent prompts for production review flows.

## [2.0.0] - 2026-04-13

### Added

- `kicad-sch-api`-backed schematic surface with hierarchy, connectivity, and auto-placement helpers.
- FreeRouting orchestration, DSN/SES staging, and rule-file routing tools.
- Live component search, detail, BOM pricing, stock, and alternative-part lookup.
- SPICE simulation tools with InSpice-first and ngspice fallback execution.
- Signal integrity, power integrity, EMC compliance, DFM profile, HDI/multilayer, and Git checkpoint tool families.
- Focused v2 server profiles for `schematic_only`, `pcb_only`, `high_speed`, `power`, `simulation`, and `analysis`.

### Changed

- Raised the runtime baseline to Python 3.12+.
- Replaced the legacy URL-only LCSC helpers with live component search tools in one breaking API transition.
- Hardened core runtime helpers, type safety, CLI discovery, and thread-safe board access.
- Switched tool discovery to show runtime metadata labels and added pagination/filtering to large PCB read tools.
- Bumped package, runtime, and registry metadata to `2.0.0`.

## [1.0.5] - 2026-04-13

### Changed

- Bumped project release version to 1.0.5 across package/runtime/registry metadata.

## [1.0.0] - 2026-04-13

### Added

- Public distribution and CLI branding as `kicad-mcp-pro`.
- Src-based `kicad_mcp` package layout.
- Config-driven project discovery and cross-platform KiCad CLI lookup.
- MCP resources, prompts, profiles, and refactored project/PCB/schematic/export tooling.
- Packaging, CI, docs, registry metadata, and Docker assets.
