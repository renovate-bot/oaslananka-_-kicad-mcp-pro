## [Unreleased]

## [3.0.2] - 2026-04-27

### Fixed

- Fixed Claude Code `stdio` startup races by deferring heavy tool/resource registration
  until after the MCP `initialize` handshake can bind.
- Added an e2e regression test that sends `initialize` immediately after process spawn.

### Changed

- Bumped project release version to 3.0.2 across package/runtime/registry metadata.

## [3.0.1] - 2026-04-27

### Added

- Added HTTP token rotation, per-tool metrics, request audit logging, heavy-tool rate limiting, and expanded server-card capability negotiation.
- Added explicit variant selection for gated manufacturing package export.
- Added `project_generate_design_prompt()` and AC PDN impedance estimates for `check_power_integrity()`.
- Added release-hardening tests for profile discovery, fixer imports, gate-history migrations, watcher locking, CLI retry behavior, structured errors, metadata linting, and benchmark latency.

### Changed

- Bumped project release version to 3.0.1 across package/runtime/registry metadata.
- Tool execution failures now return MCP `isError` results with structured `error_code`, `message`, and `hint` content for capable clients.
- Published tool descriptions are normalized to meet metadata lint requirements.
- Deprecated `tune_track_length()` now emits a `UserWarning` in addition to the existing structured log warning.

### Fixed

- Fixed discovery gaps for validation CLI tools and the `builder`, `critic`, and `release_manager` profile surface.
- Fixed `_SyncServerHandle.list_tools()` returning a coroutine when called inside an active event loop.
- Fixed studio watch auto-detection overriding an explicitly configured project directory.
- Added `PRAGMA user_version` schema versioning for gate-history SQLite databases.

## [3.0.0] - 2026-04-26

### Added

- Added `sch_add_missing_junctions()` plus automatic T-intersection junction insertion for generated schematic wiring.
- Added `project_full_validation_loop()` for bounded ERC/DRC/quality-gate fix iteration and `project_gate_trend()` for persisted gate history inspection.
- Added `professional_circuit_design` and `post_placement_routing` prompts to make agent workflows deterministic from schematic capture through routing.
- Added a grid-based schematic A* router, a lightweight PDN mesh solver, project-local gate-history persistence, and ten new YAML subcircuit blueprints.

### Changed

- `pcb_sync_from_schematic()` now has backward-compatible `force` and `auto_place` options, blocks unsafe syncs behind a pre-sync gate by default, and can run force-directed placement after successful sync.
- Schematic wire writes now deduplicate duplicate segments and merge collinear runs before persisting.
- Schematic routing now avoids symbol bodies with A*/Z-route fallback instead of blindly drawing L-routes through obstacles.
- Placement and routing prompts now include post-placement DSN export, FreeRouting, SES import, zone refill, and DRC steps.
- `pcb_place_decoupling_caps()` now applies value-specific proximity rules for common bypass and bulk capacitors.
- Bumped project release version to 3.0.0 across package/runtime/registry metadata.

### Fixed

- Fixed missing junctions on T-intersections that could make visually connected schematic wires absent from the netlist.
- Fixed pre-sync PCB transfer behavior so ERC/connectivity/annotation failures are blocked unless explicitly forced.

## [2.4.2] - 2026-04-18

### Fixed

- Made Azure DevOps release validation resilient to expired or unavailable `SAFETY_API_KEY` credentials so `pip-audit` remains the enforced dependency gate instead of breaking the publish pipeline on auth failures.

### Changed

- Bumped project release version to `2.4.2` across package, runtime, and registry metadata for the Azure CI/CD patch cut.

## [2.4.1] - 2026-04-18

### Fixed

- Refreshed the locked `authlib` dependency to `1.7.0` on the shipped release line so the default branch and release metadata no longer surface the resolved CSRF advisory.

### Changed

- Bumped project release version to `2.4.1` across package, runtime, and registry metadata for the post-`2.4.0` security patch cut.

## [2.4.0] - 2026-04-17

### Added

- Project manifest, gate-history, design-intent, and layer-coverage MCP resources plus high-speed, bringup, DFM polish, and regression prompt workflows.
- An opt-in Prometheus `/metrics` endpoint for Streamable HTTP deployments when `KICAD_MCP_ENABLE_METRICS=true`.
- `Dockerfile.kicad10` for CI images that extract `kicad-cli` from an official KiCad 10 AppImage supplied at build time.
- `vcs_tag_release()` plus recovery-branch creation during checkpoint restore.

### Changed

- Extended schematic spatial tooling so bounding boxes now include actual pin extents, `sch_find_free_placement` can honor rectangular keepout regions, and `sch_auto_place_functional` can preserve anchored symbols while applying project-spec functional spacing.
- Expanded subcircuit template inspection output to include declared left/right pin lists for each bundled template.
- Upgraded placement scoring with critical-net Manhattan proxy metrics and thermal-hotspot proximity scoring, and hardened the headless force-directed placer with keepout-aware constraints, grid snapping, and wall-clock budgets.
- Hardened FreeRouting orchestration with a pinned Docker image default, Docker-to-JAR fallback, FreeRouting 2.x CLI flags, timeout control, DRC report output support, and structured routing telemetry.
- Extended high-speed preflight checks with critical-frequency via-stub resonance warnings, package-envelope thermal via sizing, and design-intent-driven EMC return-path continuity sweeps.
- Expanded Azure validation with a Windows unit-test job and dependency audit gates for release readiness.

### Fixed

- Added SPICE directive validation for simulation sidecar entries while keeping existing analysis directives backward compatible.
- Blocked checkpoint commits that include KiCad session scrap files such as `.kicad_pro.lock` and `~$*` artifacts.

## [2.3.2] - 2026-04-16

### Fixed

- Removed the optional `InSpice` extra dependency from published package metadata so the vulnerable transitive `diskcache` runtime dependency is no longer installed with `simulation`.
- Cleaned an accidentally tracked `.history` gitlink from benchmark fixtures and ignored future editor history folders so GitHub checkout and Pages builds no longer fail on missing submodule metadata.

### Changed

- Clarified simulation documentation to describe `ngspice` CLI as the default backend with manual `InSpice` support when users install it explicitly.

## [2.3.1] - 2026-04-16

### Changed

- Aligned the release tag with the current `main` branch after Azure CI/CD stabilization changes.
- Wired the root Azure pipeline to the shared PyPI credential group and removed the environment gate from the publish stage so automated release runs complete end-to-end.
- Kept GitHub and Azure release automation in sync for the clean patch cut.

## [2.3.0] - 2026-04-16

### Added

- KiCad 10 sidecar-backed design variants with BOM diff/export helpers.
- Time-domain routing helpers, tuning profiles, graphical DRC rule management, 3D PDF export, and manufacturing import commands.
- KiCad Studio context resource support, local HTTP bridge documentation, `.well-known` discovery metadata, and Azure DevOps pipeline definition.
- Unit/property tests and KiCad 10 benchmark fixtures for new routing, variant, design-intent, and studio flows.

### Changed

- Added inferred MCP tool annotations, progress reporting for long-running tools, and client-side sampling integration in the auto-fix loop.
- Hardened cache invalidation, path handling, release documentation, and manual GitHub fallback guidance around Azure DevOps-first CI/CD.
- Normalized project documentation and user-facing messages to consistent English wording.

### Fixed

- Removed stale TTL cache behavior across project/schematic/PCB mutations and test runs.
- Stabilized schematic move behavior to use deterministic file-based updates during automated flows.
- Aligned quality gates, router profile declarations, lint/type expectations, and release metadata for full-suite validation.

## [2.0.2] - 2026-04-14

### Fixed

- Restored complete sdist/wheel contents for package installs and `uvx` entrypoints.
- Preserved environment-based MCP client configuration unless CLI options explicitly override it.
- Preferred KiCad 10 `pcb export gerbers` and kept singular `gerber` as a fallback.

### Changed

- Raised the runtime baseline to Python 3.12+.
- Replaced the legacy URL-only LCSC helpers with live component search tools in one breaking API transition.
- Hardened core runtime helpers, type safety, CLI discovery, and thread-safe board access.
